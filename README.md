# ToDoList

## Purpose

This is an application that I made during the second year at university.

## Technology used

The app is structured on MVVM design pattern, using commands, C# and WPF.

## Features

In the main window, the user can see on the upper-left a list of ToDoLists, in the upper-right a list of Tasks corresponding the selected ToDoList can be seen. Also, in the lower-left the user can see his statistics and in the lower-right a description of the selected Task. The user can save the created ToDoList or he can create a new one. Also, he can create, edit, move-up, move-down etc. a ToDoList or Task. He can see a sorted list of Tasks by different criteria or even filter them.
